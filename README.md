# Wall Music Flutter Web Application

Live Site: [Here](https://wall-music-flutter.web.app)

This project was developed as a follow up project to my [music discord bot](https://github.com/LukeLeimbach/music-discord-bot) web app. Originally created in React, this project takes the same idea and implements it with Flutter. This web app, while not pretty, searches YouTube to find songs based on a user's search query. The user can then add their song to a "queue" on Cloud Firestore which can then be played on Discord.
